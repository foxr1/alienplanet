### Artwork
The build and menu icons were created by me using Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator.

### Terrain Tools Sample Asset Pack
Used for some of the terrain modelling and textures used on the planet surface. ([Link](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/2d/textures-materials/nature/terrain-tools-sample-asset-pack-145808))

### Outdoor Ground Textures
Used for multiple textures on planet surface. ([Link](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/2d/textures-materials/floors/outdoor-ground-textures-12555))

### Dream Forest Tree
Used for some of the vegation in the scene. ([Link](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/vegetation/trees/dream-forest-tree-105297))

### Standard Assets for Unity
Used for the water in the scene and modified the given lens flares for the UFO and sun. The lake in the scene uses the higher quality water and the river uses a lower quality one to avoid low framerate.

### UFO Model
Used a UFO model from TurboSquid. ([Link](https://www.turbosquid.com/3d-models/free-3ds-model-flying-saucer/1081073))
